# Engines

An agent's **engine** implements its contract. The closed set is `pending`, `code`, `tool`,
`decide`, `llm`, `loop` and `human`. This page covers `pending`, `code`, `tool`, `llm` and `human`;
see [decide](decide.md) and [loop and tools](loop-and-tools.md) for the other two.

Every engine except `pending` can emit `error`. Engine parameters live under a key named after the
engine (`code:`, `tool:`, `llm:`, …).

## `pending` — a contract without an implementation

```yaml
- id: classify_ticket
  description: Decide which team owns the ticket
  engine: pending
  inputs:  { ticket: Ticket }
  outputs: { team: "enum[billing, technical, general]" }
  routes:  { billing: billing_queue, technical: kb_search, general: general_queue }
```

- `tuvl validate` checks it fully as a contract (data flow, types, routes). It is a V010 warning.
- In dev and in tests it returns a **typed stub**: schema-valid placeholder outputs and its first
  normal signal. Tests override it with `mocks`.
- `tuvl ship` refuses a project with `pending` agents, and the production runner won't load one.

Spec analysis produces `pending` agents; the TaskPlan records which engine each should become.

## `code` — a Python function

```yaml
- id: issue_refund
  description: Calculate the refund amount and record it
  engine: code
  effect: write                           # read | write | destructive; default write
  inputs:  { order: Order, reason: str }
  outputs: { refund: Refund }
  code: { run: issue_refund, with: { currency: EUR } }
  routes: { default: reply, error: END.failed }
```

```python
# agents/issue_refund.py — one @agent per file
from tuvl import agent, Ctx
from agents._generated.schemas import IssueRefundIn, IssueRefundOut


@agent("issue_refund")
async def issue_refund(inp: IssueRefundIn, ctx: Ctx) -> IssueRefundOut:
    """Calculate the refund amount and record it."""
    amount = inp.order.total if inp.reason != "partial" else inp.order.total / 2
    refund = await ctx.db.create("Refund", order_id=inp.order.id, amount=amount)
    return IssueRefundOut(refund=refund)
```

| | |
|---|---|
| Signature | `async def f(inp: <Id>In, ctx: Ctx) -> <Id>Out` or `tuple[<Id>Out, str]`. `tuvl codegen` writes the decorator, signature and docstring; you write the body. |
| Signals | Returning `Out` emits `default`; `(Out, "signal")` emits that signal (it must be routed); an exception emits `error` (`code_exception`). |
| `ctx.db` | Unit of work restricted to `spec.models`; read-only when `effect: read` (a write raises). Writes commit with the step's checkpoint. |
| `ctx` | `ctx.log` (structlog, bound to the run and agent), `ctx.run_id`, `ctx.principal`, `ctx.idempotency_key`, `ctx.http` (shared HTTP client), `ctx.artifact(ref)`, `ctx.params` (rendered `code.with`), `ctx.agent_id` |
| `effect` | Declared, because it can't be derived from Python. It drives policy (`require_human_before`) and MCP annotations. |

**Built-ins.** `run: tuvl.data_search` and `run: tuvl.data_ingest` are vector search and ingest with
typed contracts, configured by `code.with` (`collection`, `query`/`document`, `top_k`, `filter`,
`metadata`, `scope: global | run`). Search writes `[{content, metadata, score}]` to its single list
output; ingest writes the new document id to its optional single output. The `tuvl.` prefix is
reserved.

---

## `tool` — database, HTTP and MCP operations

One engine, three `use` variants. The **effect is derived**; a declared `effect` may only strengthen
it (V015), except that an HTTP `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` may declare `effect: read` (search APIs often
read via POST).

### `use: db`

```yaml
tool: { use: db, model: Order, op: read, where: { id: "{{ order_id }}" } }
tool: { use: db, model: Refund, op: create, values: { order_id: "{{ order.id }}", amount: "{{ amount }}" } }
tool: { use: db, model: Ticket, op: list, where: { status: open }, order_by: [-created_at], limit: 20 }
```

`op`: `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `list`, `upsert`. The model must be in `spec.models`
(V018). The result lands in the agent's single output — a row, or `list[Model]` for `list`; `delete`
has none. Untyped `where` values are coerced to the column type.

| op | Effect | Reserved signals |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | read | `not_found` |
| `list` | read | — |
| `create`, `update`, `upsert` | write | `conflict` |
| `delete` | destructive | `not_found` |

### `use: http`

```yaml
tool:
  use: http
  method: POST
  url: https://payments.example.com/refunds
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ${PAYMENTS_KEY}" }
  body: { order: "{{ order.id }}", amount: "{{ amount }}" }
  expect: { status: [200, 201] }
  map: { refund_ref: response.body.id }   # response.status | headers | body paths → outputs
  idempotency: auto                       # auto | none — sends Idempotency-Key
```

`GET`/`HEAD` are `read`; other methods are `write` (override to `destructive` allowed). Without
`map`, a single output receives the body. An unexpected status emits `http_<status>` when that
signal is routed; otherwise `error` (`rate_limit` for 429 and `transient` for 5xx are retryable,
`http_error` otherwise). `${VAR}` reads the environment.

### `use: mcp`

```yaml
tool: { use: mcp, server: artifact://zendesk@3, name: add_comment, args: { ticket: "{{ ticket.id }}", body: "{{ text }}" } }
```

The effect comes from the server's `readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`, else `write`. The tool's
structured content (or parsed text) fills a single output, or spreads an object across several.
The tool's input schema is pinned in `tuvl.lock`.

### Side effects and crashes

Runs are at-least-once per agent ([runtime](runtime.md)). `tool: db` writes on the primary
datasource commit with the step's checkpoint (exactly-once under `transaction: per_agent`); HTTP
calls get a stable `Idempotency-Key`; MCP calls are at-least-once, so give write/destructive tools a
`compensate` agent (V015).

## `llm` — one structured model call

```yaml
- id: reply
  description: Write the customer confirmation
  engine: llm
  inputs:  { order: Order, refund: Refund }
  outputs: { text: str }
  budget:  { timeout: 20s, max_tokens: 1500, retry: { attempts: 2, errors: [parse_error, timeout] } }
  llm:
    model: default                        # AgentModel name (type llm) or a LiteLLM model id
    system: artifact://support-voice@3    # text or a prompt artifact
    prompt: Write a short confirmation of the refund.
    skills: [artifact://refund-policy@2]
  guardrails: { output: [artifact://refund-reply-quality@2] }
  routes: { default: END, guardrail_violation: END.failed, error: END.failed,
            parse_error: END.failed, timeout: END.failed, budget_exceeded: END.failed }
```

- Every input is serialised into the prompt as a typed input block.
- The model answers with **structured output** whose schema is the agent's `outputs`.
- With more than one normal route, an `outcome: enum[<those signals>]` field is added and its value
  becomes the signal; a free-form model string can never become a signal.
- `budget.max_tokens` and `budget.timeout` are required (V011).
- Guardrails: `input`/`output` lists of `guardrail` or `judge` artifacts. A failing output judge emits
  `guardrail_violation`; an unavailable or uncertain judge fails closed (`error`).
- Secure model fields can't be inputs unless `policy.allow_secure_to_llm: true` (V020).

## `human` — a person fills a form

```yaml
- id: approval
  description: A manager approves or rejects a refund
  engine: human
  inputs:  { order: Order, message: str }
  outputs: { approved: bool, note: "str?" }   # the form
  human:
    title: "Refund for order {{ order.id }}"
    instruction: Approve this refund?
    show: [order, message]                  # inputs shown to the reviewer
    form:                                   # optional; defaults from outputs
      approved: { label: "Approve?", widget: toggle }
      note:     { label: Note, widget: textarea }
    required_group: support_manager
    assignee: "{{ order.owner_id }}"
    expires: 48h
    route_on: approved                      # bool → "true"/"false"; enum → its values
  routes: { "true": issue_refund, "false": END.rejected, expired: END.failed, error: END.failed }
```

- The run checkpoints, opens an **approval request** and becomes `waiting_human`. A synchronous
  trigger answers `202` with the run descriptor and the request.
- Answer with `POST /api/approvals/{id}` `{ values }` (or `POST /api/runs/{run_id}/human/{agent_id}`).
  Values are validated against `outputs`; the run is re-queued and continues on any worker.
- Who may answer: with `required_group`, a holder of `approvals:decide` in that group who is not the
  triggering principal; otherwise the triggering principal or `iam:admin`. `iam:admin` bypasses the
  group, never the no-self-approval rule.
- `expires` closes the request and takes the `expired` route; a late answer gets `409`.
- `form` fields must equal `outputs`; `route_on` must be a bool or enum output (V016).

In tests, an unmocked human agent stops the run: assert it with `expect.wait: human`.
